# Amortized SVGD
Amortized SVGD is a simple method which can be utilized to train black box inference networks to draw samples.

We demonstrate two examples utilizing amortized SVGD in this repository:
- Variational Autoencoder
- Langevin Sampler 
  - bayesian logistic regression


## Requirements
- Theano
- pylearn2 
- matplotlib
- sklearn
- tqdm


## Paper

We would put the paper on Arxiv soon.
